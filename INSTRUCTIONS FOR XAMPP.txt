In order to get this site to work, you need to set it as the root folder for a virtual host. Otherwise references will break.

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE:

- C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf:

<VirtualHost *:81>
    ServerName portfolio
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/portfolio"
    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
    <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/portfolio">
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

- in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host:


127.0.0.1          portfolio

IMPORTANT! Make sure you as a user can save modifications in file. Go into permissions and change it.


MY FINAL URL IS THEN: 
portfolio:81





--- AND DONE! ---
