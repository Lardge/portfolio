                <p>As a complement to all formal stuff, I'd like to share some fun facts. First off, I love playing and producing music. Give it a listen at my <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/larsbf">soundcloud.</a> Also, I've always loved graphic design. Until University years I used to draw and create digital content with my wonderful "wacom bamboo". I later would leave the pen and take a hold in music for some time, but I never loosing the desire to create awesome visuals.

                    <br> What is really compelling with web development is that you need to combine structure, problem-solving, deep technical knowledge and creativity in order to achieve greatness. As I started my education at university, I knew that I wanted techingal challanges, but not just to purley stare at numbers. But not to forget the audience you are creating the application for. You need as much social understanding as technical. </p>
